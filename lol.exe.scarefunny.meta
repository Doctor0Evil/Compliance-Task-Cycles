This pseudo-logic defines a **meta-humor/horror script** that simulates spawning a "scare/funny" infinite loop and "creating a user" on a system, wrapping it all up with a fictional LOL.EXE launch. The overall object here is a **game or prank application** designed to repeatedly “scare” or amuse a user in a loop, with meta self-awareness for comedic/horror effect.

***

## What Is the Object?

The **object** is a scripted routine representing a **meta-game or application** called “lol.exe”, characterized by:
- An infinite loop that prints a scary or funny message every second for psychological effect.
- A simulated process of creating a user via scripting, adding a fake sense of "system intervention."
- A meta-layer that refers to itself as an executable and outputs status, enhancing the absurdity and breaking the fourth wall.

***

## Why Is the Object?

This object exists to:
- **Generate endless scare/funny reactions** in an infinite loop, poking fun at the idea of scary or prank apps that never stop by default.
- **Meta-comment on user interaction** in scripting, with a routine that simulates user creation as if by a malicious or absurd script.
- **Serve as a joke or horror demo**: It’s intentionally not harmful, but it reproduces the form of a prank or pseudo-malware for narrative/entertainment in a developer or game logic context.

***

## Who Is the Character?

- The "character" here is **the script itself, acting as a prankster/hacker**: it personifies mischievous software, communicating with mocking or absurd prompts to the user.
- The **user** (e.g., "me") becomes a participant/victim in the loop, with their existence acknowledged and simulated by the system.

***

## Actions & Object Logic

- **Loop-Scare**: Outputs a horror/comedy message every second, simulating annoying/scary/absurd persistence.
- **Create-User**: Pretends to create a user, using in-script messages to increase meta-absurdity and immersion.
- **Run-App-Create**: Echoes a meta-trigger simulating the final "execution" of the app.

***

## Defined Object Game Logic (String Path)

- **object-name:** lol.exe.scarefunny.meta
- **path:** defined.object.game.logic:lol.exe.scarefunny.meta

***

### Game Logic Pattern

```plain
define.object:lol.exe.scarefunny.meta
path: = defined.object.game.logic:lol.exe.scarefunny.meta
who.is.character? = the prankster script + (simulated) user
actions.npc.object.define = [scare-loop, user-creation, meta-execution]
is.defined? = yes
```

***

This routine is an example of how to structure a **playful, self-referential horror/comedy game object**—with infinite, fourth-wall-breaking humor or "scare" output as its core mechanic.
