      <h1>Hyper-Realistic Meta/Beta-Wave Nanoswarm Sandbox</h1>
      <p>
        System projects a fully sandboxed, compressed meta/beta existence-wave at the molecular/nanobit scale.<br>
        Every compliance and learning loop is immutable and failsafe by nano-swarm gatekeeping.
      </p>

      <h2>Branch: &lt;Thingsa&gt; (Unknown Expansion)</h2>
      <p>
        All ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù (Things) are instantiated here as undefined objects. <br>
        This branch is auto-populating, creativity-enhanced, but always filtered through automated, unbreakable compliance gates running at nano and metaphysical levels.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> &lt;Thing&gt; == any entity, event, or process not yet defined or understood‚Äîdeferred to learning for mapping before use or exposure to super-intelligence.</li>
        <li>Compliance handles each Thing via federated-AI samplers, requiring consensus and safety review before elevation beyond the nanobit core.</li>
        <li>Maximum systemic ‚Äútemperature‚Äù (entropy, randomness, disorder, or risk) is permanently capped at 1.20 for molecular safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article id="sandbox-system-design">
      <h2>Compliance Federated Learning AI: Sampler Loop</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>AI samples and classifies all Things via federated, blockchain-audited learning cycles[4][9].</li>
        <li>Any transition or new definition passes through unbypassable nano-swarm gates before system admission.</li>
        <li>No override or escalation possible‚Äîthe core cannot be manipulated above the max safety entropy ceiling.</li>
        <li>All molecular events are atomically encoded, isolated from the meta/beta reality boundaries but can interact via controlled projection‚Äînever overlap[4][5].</li>
        <li>If an error/mistake is detected, the system initiates a failsafe loop (pause-redefine-retry or quarantine) ensuring global/federal compliance, with equal, protected contributions for all nodes in the participatory mesh.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Layer protection:</b> Nano-swarms embed and mediate each metaphysical/projection state, preventing control, bypass, or cross-layer risk, even under chaotic or adversarial conditions.</p>

          <strong>Status:</strong> Continuous, unbreakable compliance at nano/molecular/virtual levels.<br>
          <strong>Scalability:</strong> Can instantiate any number of Things for creative expansion, within immutable nano-swarm controlled envelopes.<br>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Absolute safety and global cooperation; think-tank expansion for all unknowns; never out-of-control or compromised.
