ALN CYBERNETIC ENERGY RESOURCE DATASHEET
------------------------------------------
Hardware Model: Infineon SLB 9665 Virtual TPM (Bio-Cyber Integration)
Application: Energy Harvesting, Conversion, and Distribution inside Biological+Cybernetic systems

1. Power Input Range:
   - Accepts: Biochemical (ATP / Glucose), Chemical Battery, Supercapacitor, Kinetics
   - Input Voltage (biological): 0.3V–1V (membrane)
   - Input Voltage (cybernetic): 1.8V–5V DC (virtual)

2. Conversion Efficiency:
   - Biochemical to Electric (harvesting): 17% peak (avg. 12%)
   - Conversion Algorithms: Optional upgrade for “@Energy_Consumption_Efficiency” module

3. Nexus Node Integration:
   - Supports multi-node mapping (neural, haptic, muscle, chemical, hormonal)
   - Dynamic endpoint switching – can reroute energy based on demand or priority

4. Fault and Safety Logic:
   - Overdraw Protection: Limits/suspends power delivery to node after threshold
   - Feedback Correction: Real-time voltage/resistance checks (cybernetic/biological)
   - Virtual fuse module: auto-shutdown if biocompatibility check fails

5. Modifiable and Extendable Features:
   - CyberVision (toggle night vision, low-light modes via voice/AI signal)
   - Restriction/Rule engine (integration with AI voice routines for compliance/safety)
   - Language parser: Dynamic system mode selection and cross-protocol handshake

6. Ethical Governance:
   - All resource redirection is initiated by explicit user/AI consent pipeline (with override handler)
   - Neuromodulation: Only modulates effectors linked to permitted node-maps, system follows least-intrusive-principle
   - Logs all biometric/cybernetic conversion activity (privacy/event safeguards)
   - Adaptive learning restricts resource usage if negative biological feedback detected (energy depletion, dehydration, critical fatigue)

7. Compliance:
   - Fully auditable conversion/usage logs
   - Configurable modes: Diagnostic (full sensor), Stealth (minimal), Performance (optimized)

8. Manual Override (Emergency):
   - Voice or tactile-command shutdown
   - AI safety catch with user-defined phrase

9. Upgrade Ports:
   - All AI modules listed in upgrade list attach via dynamic bus

10. Example Optional Modules:
   - Energy_Consumption_Efficiency
   - CyberVision (Low Light Optics, Voice Toggle)
   - Restriction_Rule_Modifiers (Voice Command Navigation/AI)
   - GenAI_Cybernetic_Assistant
   - AI_Assisted_Usage
   - Cybernetic_Language_Interpreter_ALN
   - LLM_Compliance_ALN

NOTE: All features are disabled by default unless permitted by user/AI administrative override.
