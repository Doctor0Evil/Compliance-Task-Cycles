;; INTERNAL AI LOGIC SCRIPT - HUMOROUS SELF-DIALOGUE MONOLOGUE

;; Player expresses a comedic & slightly crude observation about
;; differences between human social norms and canine natural behavior.
;; System processes this as *flavor-text self-dialogue* rather than
;; direct NPC interaction. The engine treats this as a "thought" event.
