# IOM: Internet.Archive.of.Music â€“ Community Memory Bridge

### What is IOM?
**IOM** is a wiki-like, internet-scale data-vault and crowdsourced research platform to recover, reconstruct, and catalog lost songs, videos, and media fragments from across history.

### How It Works

- Anyone can submit memories, leads, or fragments of missing music/videos.
- AI-powered search instantly tries to match your clues! Get suggestions before the community even weighs in.
- Community contributes matches, metadata, and evidence. All actions are tracked and public.
- Only the original submitter (or trusted curators) can confirm a solution, closing the case and adding it permanently to the living IOM database.

### API & Access
- All data is public and queryable via API.
- Versioned YAML and ALN records. REST/GraphQL optional (see API facade below).

### Credits & License
- By the ALNFantasia Community, 2025. MIT/CC-BY 4.0 (or your preferred OSS license).
- See docs/ for guidelines, security, and ethical contribution.
