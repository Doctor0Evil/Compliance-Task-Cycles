# ALNFantasia Bestiary

## A. Aggressive Horrors

### 1. Wailborn Matron (formerly Banshee)
- **Appearance:** Withered woman draped in burial linens, mouth unstitched but eternally screaming through the seams.
- **Behavior:** Floats in shadows, screams drop player stamina to zero if unprepared.
- **Lore:** Spirits of mothers who died in childbirth, cursed to cry out endlessly.
- **Drops:** "Sewn Tongue" → alchemical catalyst for fear-based spells.
- **Quest Hook:** Collecting 3 for an undertaker's ritual to silence the graveyard.

### 2. Screaming Whelp (formerly Banshee Baby)
- **Appearance:** Newborn form, fused with cloth swaddle, jaw unhinged like a frog's.
- **Behavior:** Latched to walls; shrieks summon its "Matron."
- **Lore:** Stillborn souls reanimated as bait.
- **Drops:** "Whelp Bone Charm."

### 3. Gnash-Jawed (formerly Black Chomper / Red Chomper)
- **Appearance:** Featureless humanoid skulls with jaws elongated to their chest, teeth scraping as they walk.
- **Behavior:** Leap-biting ambushers. Black variant = hides in shadows. Red variant = blood eruptions when hit.
- **Lore:** Victims of starvation cults, jaws cursed to infinite hunger.
- **Drops:** "Teeth Cluster" (weapon upgrade).

### 4. Veil Bride (formerly Bride / Corpse Bride)
- **Appearance:** Shattered porcelain mask hides empty eye sockets dripping wedding wax.
- **Behavior:** Appears passive until approached, then rends veil into bladed strands.
- **Lore:** Symbol of spoiled unions—spirits of betrayed lovers bound in ceremonial prisons.
- **Drops:** "Wedding Veil Fragments" (ritual armor).

### 5. Centi-Hag (formerly Centipede)
- **Appearance:** Half-woman torso with dozens of centipede legs, wears old silken shrouds.
- **Behavior:** Crawls walls, lashes with insect legs; bites inflict venomous fever.
- **Lore:** Witches who feasted on rot in life, remade as insect mothers.
- **Drops:** Venom sacs, husked legs.

## B. Passive Horrors
Cursed wildlife / incomplete horrors—often scavengers, neutral until provoked.

### 1. Slink-Hog (formerly Pig)
Bloated corpse-swine that roots for flesh, tolerates players unless attacked. Drops fatty sinew.

### 2. Root-Hare (formerly Rabbit)
Rabbit skeletons animated by thorny roots, creep slowly but bolt if watched.

### 3. Carrion-Bird (formerly Raven)
Jet-black feathers dripping with tar; eats dead—but shrieks to call stronger beings if disturbed.

### 4. Wither-Snout (formerly Snout)
Half-rotted humanoid with boar-like face, constantly rooting in dirt. Passive until cornered.

## C. Peaceful Horrors
Terrifying in design, but usually non-aggressive unless cursed.

### 1. Soot Villagers (formerly Villagers / Burning Villager)
- Ash-filled husks wearing faint smiles, endlessly stuck in routines of village life. Non-hostile—until fire is near (then frenzy).

### 2. Vine-Taken (formerly Vine)
- Human forms strangled mid-step, held upright by cursed vines that still move faintly. Whisper with stolen voices.

### 3. Growth-Ling (formerly Growths)
- Tumorous blob creatures, glowing with veins, they pulse rhythmically. Peaceful unless harvested.
