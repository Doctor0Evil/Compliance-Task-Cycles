Night Whispers Game World: Blueprint & Template (Mature-Audience "Urban Legend" Survival Horror)

1. Core World Principles

Setting & Themes
A sprawling, decaying city limned by rain and shadows, where folklore births reality. The city's heart is a labyrinth—wards split by alleyways, sunken parks, ancient tenements, derelict amusements, drowned subways, each crumbling under the weight of urban myths.
Environment is dynamic: Each zone's mood (fog, rainfall, lighting, rumor-intensity) changes by time, weather, recent events, and local stories.
Creatures and horrors evolve as legends are fed or debunked.

Visual/Audio Tone
Constant dread, liminality, and spectral beauty.
Audio cues: unnatural hush, children's laughter in rain, music box drifts, sudden metallic groan, urban cacophony peaking and falling with the wind.
Flickering lights, creeping mildew, fungal blooms in odd shadowed corners; sometimes your own reflection moves out of sync.
Explicit: Scenes of haunting domesticity-turned-wrong, subtle adult themes of loss, betrayal, trauma, and desire woven through both major and minor events.

2. Major Factions & Subsystems

A. Character Modules

Major NPCs
Each signature figure (e.g., Candle-Eyed Widow, Bone Collector, Whispering Barber, Maggot Seamstress, Root-Hands Hermit, etc.):
Provides questlines (personal and urban-myth scale).
Is both potentially ally and antagonist.
Motivated by secrets, taboos, bargains—think dark fairy tales for grownups.
Often linked to a tragedy, shame, or urban sin (addiction, infanticide, spousal murder, old debts).

Minor NPCs
Seed rumors, act as red herrings, lure or subtly warn the player.
Serve as information brokers, rare commodity shopkeepers, cryptic negotiators, or witnesses to the city's cycles of horror.

Monstrosities
Urban legends made flesh. Each has unique lore, rules, and "ritual vulnerability."
True banes only discoverable via world interaction—no stat sheets.
Their existence is quantum, sometimes fading if disbelieved or taking more horrifying forms as fear increases.
E.g.: The Chimney Twin (only harms those who've heard their rhyme); Monster Snail (attracted by careless food waste/rubbish offerings).

B. Trust/Alignment & Personality
Every NPC (including monsters) tracks hidden stats:
Trust (how much they believe/ally with you)
Fear (worry you may be another monster)
Intrigue (whether you're worth their gamble)
Horror (are you a walking blasphemy?)
Dialogue, quest outcomes, and rumor chains shift as these values rise/fall. Betray and you may be cursed, stalked, or lose essential guides. Befriend, and you might learn a monster's tragic secret (even leverage it).

C. Player Progression
Reputation: Tracked city-wide and per district. Notoriety and myth alter how the world responds, what quests/rumors appear, and which endings become available.
Sanity & Insight:
Sanity decays with exposure to "the anomalous," personal failures, and betrayal.
Insight unlocks deeper truths—may reveal secret areas, banes, or grant power—but risks temporary or permanent debilitation, reality distortion, or "attention" from greater horrors.
Afflictions: Infection (fungal, viral, parasitic), cursed tokens, psychological vulnerabilities—each offering narrative/strategic drawbacks and opportunities.

4. Quest & Folklore Infrastructure

Urban Legend Chain System
"Meta-quests" that live and mutate: rumors (from NPCs, graffiti, objects) become true if enough talk, fear, or ritual action is devoted, altering district hazards, quest flow, and even physics (e.g., walking backwards at midnight in Lantern Alley summons the Candle-Eyed Widow).
Player can feed, break, or redirect these chains by action, rumor, and theft or destruction of key folktale items.

Dynamic Rumor Engine
Minor NPCs actively seed, alter, and mix rumors.
True/false/embellished: e.g., "So-and-so died in the park—unless you pay the toll."
"Rumor Status" overlays can be toggled in debug or by player skill/affliction.
Rumors dynamically spawn encounters, locks, hidden items, and even new quest-givers or antagonists.

Event Types
Psychological (interrogate, seduce, outwit—betray or be betrayed)
Survival (manage wounds, hunger, affliction—seek "safe" shelter from both creature and weather)
Supernatural confrontation (discover or perform the right legend/ritual to banish, pacify, or bind threats. Fail, and consequences escalate city-wide)
