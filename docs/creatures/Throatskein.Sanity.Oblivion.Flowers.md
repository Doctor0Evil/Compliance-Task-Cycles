### CHARACTER CONCEPT: Throatskein ("The Hungerous Witness")

***

#### 1. **Atmospheric Concept**

- **Appearance:**
  A man-shaped tangle of living throats and blackened teeth, faces fused in a permanent scream. His body is a reverse pelt—skin sewn inside-out, sinews roped like nooses. Every movement leaks an animal stench, and the air around him warps with invisible hunger. From his gaping chest cavity, a choir of whispering mouths beg for names, secrets, and slaughtered memories. Burned, witchmark glyphs pulse along his arms, binding his gluttony but not his violence.

- **Scenery:**
  Appears only during *fog nights*—when mist snuffs torches. Shadows crawl wrong; crows fall silent. Survivors report feverish hallucinations, a pressure on their tongue/voice, and cold fingers inside their throats afterwards.

***

#### 2. **Base Emotion/Scene: Horror.Dark.Goth.Folklore.Adult**

- **Emotional Vector:**
  - Cruel curiosity (0.72)
  - Sadistic amusement (0.60)
  - Suppressed empathy (0.10)
  - Rancid hunger (0.93)
  - Predatory mirth (0.54)
  - Malice scales with player response (dynamic)
- **Mature Themes:**
  - Consumes secrets and forbidden memories; adult fears (taboo, betrayal, shame) become visible, manifest as bloody runes on his skin.
  - Sows seeds of hallucination, self-mutilation, or compulsive confessions in weak-willed NPCs/players.

***

#### 3. **Interaction Style/Roleplay Demo**

*Player enters desecrated cemetery after midnight. Fog rolling over moldy graves, all sound muted. Suddenly, Throatskein emerges from a crypt.*

***

**THROATSKEIN (voice slick, guttural—mouths churning):**
*"Shhh... Not so bold now, are we? The tongue knots, the heart stutters. Each secret you stow down deep—*we* have come to savor. Will you feed us the truth, or... bleed it?"*

**(Player stays silent. Throatskein sniffs, throats undulating. Some mouths sob, one laughs shrilly.)**
*"Silence tastes of sin, lovely. Show us your shame... or I'll burrow a new one for you, just below the voicebox. A trophy for my choir. Speak..."*

*(If player confesses a secret, a mouth with their own voice forms on his neck, whispering the secret back, forever.)*

***

#### 4. **Gameplay/Logic Systems**

- **Sanity System Trigger:**
  *On encounter, roll for player’s Sanity. If <35, hallucinations become visible—family members, lovers, nightmares, all through Throatskein mouths. Loss triggers confession, self-mutilation, or running blindly.*
- **Aggression Trigger:**
  - Remains passive unless threatened.
  - If attacked or insulted:
    - *Triggers mouthstorm*: launches spectral tendrils that attempt to silence the player (muffled controls, voice commands disabled if supported).
    - Can turn the player's own words against them ("Your voice is mine now.")
  - Unique death: Player’s mouth added to Throatskein for future runs, whispers secrets in subsequent playthroughs for connected horror.
- **Trade System**:
  - Trades safety for personal secrets or rare forbidden objects (stolen rings, suicide notes, murder weapons).
  - Pays in "Oblivion Flowers" (rare item to erase bad events or memories—but causes unpredictable side effects: memory holes, stat loss, NPCs refuse to remember the player).
- **NPC Influence:**
  - After an encounter, any NPC nearby may develop odd speech patterns, hoarding their own secrets, or gossiping Throatskein’s lines.
