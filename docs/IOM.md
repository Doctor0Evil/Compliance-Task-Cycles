# Internet Archive of Music (IOM)

- **Concept**: A massive data pool where **players archive & recover lost cultural content** (music, videos, lore fragments).
- **Process**:
  1. User requests a missing piece.
  2. Community “flags” with upvotes when correct.
  3. Entry becomes permanent in the **IOM Codex Vault**.

ALN Structure:

```aln
