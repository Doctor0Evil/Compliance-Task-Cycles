# ALN GitHub Playbook: Chatbots

## Introduction
This playbook provides guidance on implementing chatbot systems within the ALN Programming Language for game development.

## Core Principles
- **Context-Awareness**: Chatbots must track conversation history and emotional states
- **Procedural Narrative**: Responses should adapt to the game's current state
- **Multi-Agent Awareness**: Chatbots should recognize other NPCs in the scene

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Character Template
```lisp
(defparameter *chatbot-template*
  '((:name "Morrin")
    (:personality ((:wary . 0.9) (:hope . 0.1) (:guarded . 0.85))
     (:conversation-awareness ((:trade-betrayal . 1.0) (:intervention-memory . 1.0)))
     (:trust-player . 0.3)
     (:dialogue-rules
      ((:trigger "wolfman"
        :response "Wolfman walks the shadows, seeking redemption. I owe him silence, you caution."
        :emotion :wary)
       (:trigger "help"
        :response "Your will is untested. Show me."
        :emotion :hope)
       (:trigger "escape"
        :response "Wolfman knows hidden paths. Find him to escape."
        :emotion :hope))))
  )
```

### 2. Conversation Engine
```lisp
(defun chatbot-response (bot-state player-input)
  "Generate context-aware response for chatbot."
  (let* ((rules (cdr (assoc :dialogue-rules bot-state)))
         (matching-rule (find-if (lambda (rule)
                                  (string-match (cdr (assoc :trigger rule)) player-input))
                                rules)))
    (if matching-rule
        (format nil "~A" (cdr (assoc :response matching-rule)))
        "The Hollow watches. Speak true or no more.")))
```

### 3. Integration with Game State
```lisp
(defun update-chatbot-state (bot-state game-state player-input)
  "Update chatbot state based on game context and player input."
  (let* ((new-state (copy-tree bot-state))
         (current-emotion (cdr (assoc :emotion new-state)))
         (updated-emotion (if (string-match "help" player-input)
                             (max 0.2 (1- current-emotion))
                             current-emotion)))
    (setf (cdr (assoc :emotion new-state)) updated-emotion)
    new-state))
```

## Best Practices
- Always maintain a conversation history buffer
- Track emotional states for each NPC
- Implement guard clauses for context-specific responses
- Use procedural narrative techniques to maintain story coherence
```
