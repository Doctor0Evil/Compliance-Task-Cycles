## Procedural Narrative: The Future of Video Games

Indie Game Dev, Bryan Cohen, recently asked me this rather ballsy question about narrative design.

Bryan: "Given the recent trend of procedural generation in games that often have very shallow storytelling, what role do you see procedural and emergent narrative taking in the future, and what sort of challenges and problems need to be solved before we (as developers) can deliver a compelling experience going this route?"

Ok, first up...sorry, Bryan, I'm not going to even attempt to tackle the 'emergent narrative' side of the question because I think that procedural narrative and emergent narrative are two very different things. Maybe I'll explain the differences in a follow-up article. In the meantime, let's focus in on **Procedural Narrative** and the potential future it has in video game storytelling.

I personally think that procedural generation is a wonderful breath of fresh air, blowing away a lot of stale thinking and stale storytelling in the games industry. To be honest, it freaks the shit out of many a narrative designer. Why? Because it's impossible to rely on tried and true structures like "3 Acts" and "The Hero's Journey" when anything could happen in the game at any time. Suddenly, the player isn't just going along for the ride on a nice, smooth character arc. This isn't Booker DeWitt coming to terms with his past. This isn't Joel and Ellie building a relationship only to have the hostile world threaten to tear it apart.

With procedural generation, the game is reacting to what the *player* does, not what the *character* is expected to do.

The Player = Protagonist
The Game = Antagonist
The Story = What happens as the Protag struggles to overcome the Antag.

There's no predictable plot here, because the Protag can succeed or fail in a myriad of ways. Plot is replaced by **Story Experience**.

Ok, luckily I can now plunder my own book, *Narrative Design for Indies: Getting Started*, to explain what a 'Story Experience' is and how it relates to procedural generation.

**Procedural Narrative = Story Experience**

I once heard narrative design likened to theme park design. A park ride might have a story context, a must-have for any haunted house or ghost train ride, and the ticket-holder then explores that context, feels part of that miniature world for a bit. It's a tough thing to explain in abstract so let's get concrete with one of my favorite ever Indie RPGs. *Darkest Dungeon*.

Being a rogue-like RPG, *Darkest Dungeon* is all about the experience of delving into Lovecraftian realms, surviving by the skin of your teeth and going completely bonkers in the process. There is no 'plot' beyond the usual fare of 'mad overreacher explores where he should not and unearths an ancient evil that then corrupts the entire place'. Sounds like a hundred games, stories and novels already, right? And it would've been no different to the rest had not the creators stopped right there and said, "Plot, shmot! Let's give the player a story-rich experience instead." I'm sure that wasn't their exact words, but the spirit of that statement permeates almost every element of *Darkest Dungeon*.

*Darkest Dungeon* wrangles its world design, glyphs and dialogue in such a way as to totally wrap the player in story without ever demanding that they follow any sort of plot. As soon as a player follows a plot then their choices are limited. *Darkest Dungeon*'s limits are mechanical, not narrative. You can pretty much engage with whichever elements you want, whenever you want, within the confines of what's possible for you at the time.
