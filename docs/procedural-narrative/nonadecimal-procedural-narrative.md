## Past Generative & Narrative Work

A brief career in swarm robotics created a passion for autonomous agents capable of working cooperatively and competitively. While machine vision and autonomous navigation occupied my work week, it left a lot of unresolved ideas about how a machine could understand contextual relationships in a human-dominated world and develop long-term plans to achieve its goals.

Meanwhile, writing stories and narrative puzzles for The Matrix Online MMO inspired new approaches to storytelling. While the stories began from static outlines, the input from players interacting with the stories' characters (also played by me) forced additional twists and turns into the narrative.

During this time I also worked on a handful of mathematical models, simulations intended to recreate the real world in data. A model to optimize the location of new natural gas power plants, a model to optimize the locations of a network of cell phone towers for customer service or for profit. Even a sci fi worldbuilding simulation to quickly generate scientifically accurate planets derived from an inputted gravity or surface temperature.

The trajectories of all these experiences lead to a contextual model of the world that an autonomous agent can solve to achieve its emotion-driven goals: a procedural narrative engine.

## Future Generative Narrative Work

### 1) Knowledge Representation
The characters need a way to comprehend the world they inhabit, a language to describe how objects in the world are contextually related.

### 2) Procedural World Generation
Utilizing the contextual data that defines every object that can exist in the game world, the next step is to generate the world.

### 3) Long-Term Planning
Given the contextual relationships between objects placed in the world, characters need to make plans to achieve their objectives.

### 4) Emotional Behavior
Given autonomous agents that understand how to manipulate their environments to achieve their goals, they need a reason to do things! Intrinsic motivation comes from our emotions.

### 5) Narrative Constraints and Calls to Action
At this point you have a fully functional simulation of the world. You can interact with the system, causing perturbations that ripple through the lives of the NPCs.

### 6) Natural Language Text Generation
With all this conflict happening in the form of ad hoc schemes devised by emotion-driven NPCs, they're going to desperately need a way to tell you about it and ask you to sort it all out.

## Present Work

I had the strongest ideas for the emotional behavior model and it wasn't directly dependent on the other systems, so I was able to engineer something for reacting to stimuli and storing memories with specific emotional valences.

In 2015 I also started working on a simple cyberpunk plot generator prototype for my friend's game, Black Ice. Because it's a cyberpunk hacking game set in cyberspace, it simplifies the problem by keeping social interactions limited to emails, eliminating the need for conversational dialog trees.

If done properly, the system should allow a player to subvert the original plan, either by turning on their employer when a better opportunity presents itself or even turning both parties and their corporate overlords against each other in appropriately cyberpunk fashion.
