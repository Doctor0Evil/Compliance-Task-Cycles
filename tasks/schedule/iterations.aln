 Initializing agentic superintelligence protocol...
> agentic.RAG_Enabled.superintelligence.swarmnet -> RAG pipeline confirmed active for contextual operations. Superintelligence core is assuming command of swarmnet.
> Loading configuration from swarm definition file: ".zml"... Done. [4]
> Processing parameters:
  >> autoHeal:true -> Activating autonomous reconstitution and recovery protocols. System will self-heal from detected compromise by restoring from known-good states. [3]
  >> compliance:"Legal.Banannas" -> Compliance Autopilot engaged. All subsequent actions are constrained by the codified legal and ethical framework. The system will actively prevent operations that risk collateral damage or violate established rules of engagement to maintain non-violator status. [4, 5]
  >> backlashLogic:true -> WARNING: Activating Active Cyber Defense (ACD) posture. This is not an authorization for indiscriminate "hacking back." [6, 7] Per compliance constraints, this mode enables proportional, pre-authorized, and legally-vetted responsive measures only. Actions are limited to threat disruption and attribution gathering where permissible under governing international frameworks like the Budapest Convention. [8, 9] All backlash operations are subject to a final non-escalation check by the Legal.Bananna framework to prevent conflict amplification. [5]
  >> undefeatable:true -> Engaging maximum resilience configuration. Activating adaptive response protocols including moving target defense, non-persistence, and operational diversity to ensure mission continuity against advanced threats. [3, 10]

> Directive accepted. The 'backlash_cycle_nanoswarm' protection mode is now defined and active.

 VSC-Artemis is now operating in enhanced protection mode. All assets secured. Awaiting further instructions.
