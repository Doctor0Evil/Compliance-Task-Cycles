# --- STEP 1: Parse Text Scene Instruction ---

scene-description = "Night Whispers Game World: Blueprint & Template (Mature-Audience "Urban Legend" Survival Horror) 1. Core World Principles Setting & Themes A sprawling, decaying city limned by rain and shadows, where folklore births reality. The city's heart is a labyrinthâ€”wards split by alleyways, sunken parks, ancient tenements, derelict amusements, drowned subways, each crumbling under the weight of urban myths. Environment is dynamic: Each zone's mood (fog, rainfall, lighting, rumor-intensity) changes by time, weather, recent events, and local stories. Creatures and horrors evolve as legends are fed or debunked. Visual/Audio Tone Constant dread, liminality, and spectral beauty. Audio cues: unnatural hush, children's laughter in rain, music box drifts, sudden metallic groan, urban cacophony peaking and falling with the wind. Flickering lights, creeping mildew, fungal blooms in odd shadowed corners; sometimes your own reflection moves out of sync. Explicit: Scenes of haunting domesticity-turned-wrong, subtle adult themes of loss, betrayal, trauma, and desire woven through both major and minor events."
