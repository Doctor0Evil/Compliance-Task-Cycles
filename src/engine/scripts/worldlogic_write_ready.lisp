;; User Request: instead of committing "doom.environment.lock" permanently
;; into the core game.world, we build a construct that allows:
;;   (1) Separation of world logic into "write.ready.state"
;;   (2) Ensures written consequences apply only to /alternate.instance.logic
;;   (3) Adds realism.logic.state gatecheck to ensure only permissible effects
;; Implementation guarantees: main game.world.logic remains untouched
