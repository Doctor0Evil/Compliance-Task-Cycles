- Python: Best for rapid prototyping, tons of AI/ML/NLP libraries (transformers, NLTK, spaCy, PyTorch/TensorFlow). Great for dialogue generation and context logic.
- C#: Powerful for game integration with Unity and .NET, good for type-safe scripting, async logic.
- Rust: Robust concurrent systems, great tooling for game server/AI backends, growing AI libraries.
- JavaScript/TypeScript: For web/Node/game overlays, live-editable AI, and rapid prototyping of dialogue/logic.
- C++: For real-time/AAA engines, max performance, direct memory control, used in Unreal/Source/L4D 'director'-like behavior trees.
- Lua: Embedded scripting for game engines (esp. for modding, fast reload, very lightweight and extensible).
