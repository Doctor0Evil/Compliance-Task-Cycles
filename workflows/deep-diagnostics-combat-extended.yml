;; ===============================================================
;; Extended Workflow - Humor Failure => In-Game Combat Trigger
;; ===============================================================
;; This LISP script extends diagnostic patch mechanics.
;; It integrates system DevOps workflow "failures" into the game-world
;; by translating diagnostic humor-check mismatches as NPC combat reactions.
;; Core Logic:
;;  - If humor diagnostic passes → logs sanity & compliance
;;  - If humor diagnostic fails → inject event into Combat System:
;;      * NPC taunt
;;      * Aggro check
;;      * Combat initiative roll
