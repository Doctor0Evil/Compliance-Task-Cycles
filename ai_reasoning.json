        "Randomizer: Shuffle seed with Get-Random + entropy (e.g. system time, input hash)",
        "Bias: Status/trends skewed by context (e.g. wet clothes = higher hypothermia chance)",
        "Event Masking: Nonlinear branching to make deterministic processes feel random",
        "Behavior Mutation: Current state triggers new behaviors if thresholds or rare events",
        "Dialogue: Randomly choose lines w/contextual weighting (player speech/traits/conditions)",
        "Fatigue: Reweight outcomes per rolls (dehydrated = lower agility, increased exhaustion failures)",
        "Morale: Lower morale triggers flight/cowardice, High = aggression/confidence",
        "Buff Stack: Additive/subtractive values based on traits/equipment (armor, drugs, status effects)",
